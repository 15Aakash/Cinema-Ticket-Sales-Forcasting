**Cinema Ticket Sales Forecasting (2017–2018) using R Programming**
This project analyzes and forecasts daily cinema ticket sales using advanced time series forecasting methods. By examining historical trends in ticket revenue, we identified key patterns such as weekly seasonality, short-term spikes, and gradual long-term shifts in consumer behavior. A range of models—Time Series Regression, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), ARIMA, and an Ensemble Approach—were employed to generate robust forecasts.

The final model, a Manual Ensemble Model (ARIMA + ETS), demonstrated strong predictive accuracy by capturing both seasonality and underlying trends. The 30-day operational forecast supports business planning for staffing, marketing, and inventory decisions in the entertainment sector.
